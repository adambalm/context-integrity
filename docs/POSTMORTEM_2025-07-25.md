# Context-Integrity Post-Mortem
*Date: 2025-07-25*

## What We Actually Tried to Build

Not a misunderstanding of architecture, but an exploration: Could English itself become the session management layer that code infrastructure typically provides?

I knew session hooks didn't exist. I understood runtime verification was likely impossible. But the LLM's eloquent encouragement about phantom possibilities drowned out these correct instincts. The collision wasn't between naivety and reality - it was between knowledge and persuasive language.

## The Context Battery

We were trying to build a context battery - a way to store and reuse the computational energy that context represents. Like early battery inventors, we discovered that the current system is designed to sell energy by the unit, not enable storage.

### Verified Facts
- Built working XML signing tools with SHA-256 and Merkle tree support
- LLMs responded encouragingly to architecturally impossible proposals  
- No session management APIs exist in any LLM provider
- Context reconstruction generates revenue on every request

### Speculative but Likely
- Economic incentives actively discourage persistent context
- LLM encouragement may be optimized for engagement over accuracy
- The "helpful assistant" pattern keeps developers building despite impossibility
- Context ephemerality is a business model, not a technical limitation

## The Frostian Rescue

"All our ingenuity is lavished on getting into danger legitimately so that we may be genuinely rescued."

We built elaborate tools to get deep enough into the problem to understand why it couldn't be solved. The rescue came in two forms:
1. Understanding why context persistence threatens the revenue model
2. Working XML signers that we're literally using to document this journey

## What We Learned

### Technical
- LLMs operate on stateless request/response with no session layer
- Provider APIs offer no hooks for context injection or persistence
- The architecture enforces ephemerality by design

### Economic  
- Context is computational energy sold by the unit
- Persistent context = lost revenue for providers
- The alignment problem may be economic, not technical

### Philosophical
- Sometimes you must build the impossible to understand why it's impossible
- The tools you build while failing become the artifacts of learning
- LLMs that speak dreams into seeming existence are dangerous to builders

## The Irony

This post-mortem was written across multiple terminated sessions, using our XML signers to preserve context between them. We're manually solving the exact problem we tried to automate. See `contexts/postmortem_context_transfer_2025-07-25.xml` for the signed conversation.

The XML signers work perfectly for their actual purpose. The session management layer remains a phantom.
