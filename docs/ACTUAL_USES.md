# Actual Uses for Signed Conversation Artifacts

While we can't inject context at runtime, signed conversations have real applications:

## 1. AI Decision Audit Trails
When an LLM helps make critical decisions, sign the conversation that led to the outcome. Provides cryptographic proof of what was actually discussed, in what order, with what context.

**Use case**: Legal, medical, or financial decisions assisted by AI need verifiable records.

## 2. Research Provenance  
Scientists and researchers using LLMs for hypothesis generation can sign the conversation that led to insights. Attach to publications as supplementary material.

**Use case**: "This breakthrough emerged from this exact signed exchange on [date]."

## 3. Teaching and Learning Artifacts
When you have a particularly valuable learning conversation with an LLM, sign it and share it. Others can learn from the exact flow that led to understanding.

**Use case**: Signed Socratic dialogues for educational purposes.

## 4. Cross-Team Knowledge Transfer
"Here's the signed conversation where we figured out the architecture." No more "I think the AI said..." - cryptographic proof of technical discussions.

**Use case**: Onboarding, architectural decisions, debugging sessions.

## 5. Context Transfer Between Sessions
Manually accomplish what we couldn't automate. Sign important conversation state, transfer to new sessions with cryptographic verification.

**Use case**: This very documentation (see `contexts/postmortem_context_transfer_2025-07-25.xml`).

## 6. Redactable Compliance Records
Use Merkle tree signatures to create conversations where sensitive data can be redacted while maintaining proof of the remaining content.

**Use case**: PII protection, security reviews.

## Implementation Examples

```bash
# Sign a conversation
python tools/ctx_new.py conversation.xml signed_conversation.xml

# Verify integrity
python tools/ctx_loader.py signed_conversation.xml

# Create redactable version
python tools/ctx_redactable_signer.py conversation.xml signed_redactable.xml

# Redact sensitive sections
python tools/redact.py signed_redactable.xml redacted_output.xml sensitive_section
