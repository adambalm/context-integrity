# User Stories

## 1. CLI-Focused Power User  
**As** a prompt-engineer,  
**I want** to run a single `ctx-loader` command in my terminal before I start a session,  
**so that** my workflow state is injected and validated without any manual copy/paste.

## 2. Web UI Enthusiast  
**As** a non-technical user working in the ChatGPT web interface,  
**I want** a simple browser extension or bookmarklet that auto-prepends my signed context to every new chat,  
**so that** I don’t have to learn PowerShell or Node.js and I never lose my preferences or project state.

## 3. Multi-Device Knowledge Worker  
**As** someone who switches between laptop, tablet, and phone,  
**I want** my context snapshot to sync automatically (via GitHub Gist or cloud storage) and be loaded wherever I’m chatting,  
**so that** I can pick up mid-project without re-explaining anything.

## 4. CI/CD Integrator  
**As** an SRE or DevOps engineer,  
**I want** every merge to `contexts/` to trigger an automated integrity check,  
**so that** no unsigned or drifted context ever reaches production workflows.

## 5. Collaborative Team Member  
**As** part of a distributed team using Ghost CMS and n8n,  
**I want** our shared context snapshot to carry a single trust-able hash in every Ghost post’s metadata and n8n webhook,  
**so that** we all work off the same memory contract and can audit who loaded what when.

## 6. Audit & Compliance Officer  
**As** a compliance lead in a regulated industry,  
**I want** a log of every context load (timestamp + SHA + user ID),  
**so that** I can prove what the model “knew” when it made decisions or generated recommendations.
