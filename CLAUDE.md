# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a context-integrity system that implements XML-based context management with cryptographic signing for LLM sessions. The system prevents context drift through canonicalization, SHA-256 signing, and runtime verification.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Canonicalizer** (`tools/canonicalizer.py`): Deterministic XML canonicalization (C14N) with comment stripping, whitespace collapse, and attribute sorting
- **Context Signer** (`tools/ctx_new.py`): Signs XML contexts by removing existing signatures, canonicalizing content, computing SHA-256 hash, and injecting signature
- **Context Loader/Verifier** (`tools/ctx_loader.py`): Validates signed contexts by re-canonicalizing and verifying SHA-256 signatures
- **Redactable System**: Merkle-tree-inspired signing/loading system for selective redaction (`tools/ctx_redactable_*.py`)

### Redactable System Architecture

The redactable system implements a **Merkle-tree-like** approach for selective content redaction:

- **Leaf Signing** (`tools/ctx_redactable_signer.py`): Traverses XML leaf elements (no child elements), computes SHA-256 for each element's canonical representation, stores as `sha256_leaf` attributes, builds root hash from concatenated leaf hashes
- **Selective Verification** (`tools/ctx_redactable_loader.py`): Independently validates each `sha256_leaf` attribute by re-canonicalizing without the hash attribute itself
- **Content Redaction** (`tools/redact.py`): Removes text content from specified elements while preserving `sha256_leaf` attributes and element structure

### File Structure

```
contexts/           # Signed XML context files (environmentContext.xml, etc.)
contextPackages/    # Context package definitions  
tools/              # Core implementation scripts
docs/               # Project documentation (PRD.xml, userStories.xml)
```

## Development Commands

### Python Environment
- **Dependencies**: `lxml` library required for XML processing
- **Python Version**: 3.10+ (based on environment context)

### Core Operations

#### Creating Signed Contexts
```bash
# Create and sign contexts
python tools/ctx_new.py <input.xml> <output.xml>
```

#### Loading/Verifying Contexts  
```bash
python tools/ctx_loader.py <signed_context.xml>
# Success: prints "ðŸŸ¢ CONTEXT LOADED"
# Failure: prints error and exits with code 1
```

#### XML Canonicalization
```bash
python tools/canonicalizer.py <input.xml> <output.bin>
```

### Redactable Contexts (Merkle-tree System)
```bash
# Sign with individual leaf hashes
python tools/ctx_redactable_signer.py <input.xml> <output.xml>

# Verify redactable context (validates each sha256_leaf)
python tools/ctx_redactable_loader.py <signed_context.xml>

# Redact specific fields while preserving integrity
python tools/redact.py <signed_context.xml> <redacted_output.xml> <field1> <field2>
```

## Key Technical Details

### Core Hashing (Generation 2)
- Uses lxml with C14N (Canonical XML) for deterministic serialization
- SHA-256 signatures exclude the `<sha256>` element itself to prevent circular dependencies
- Context verification is designed to halt LLM sessions on integrity violations (ðŸ”´ CONTEXT VIOLATION)
- Python tools provide clean, focused implementation of core signing/verification logic

### Redactable System (Merkle-tree Approach)
- Individual `sha256_leaf` attributes on leaf elements enable selective verification
- Root hash computed from concatenated leaf hashes provides overall integrity
- Content can be redacted while preserving cryptographic proof of original values
- Each element can be independently validated without requiring full context

### Development Status
- **Current**: Second iteration of security/hashing implementation
- **Planned**: Salt integration for enhanced security
- **Future**: HIPAA compliance capabilities
- **Roadmap**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations

## Security Model

The system implements a defensive security pattern:
- **Generation 2 hashing**: Enhanced cryptographic integrity with Merkle-tree-like leaf verification
- **Selective redaction**: Remove sensitive data while maintaining proof of original content
- **Deterministic canonicalization**: Ensures consistent hashing across platforms
- **Runtime verification**: Enforces context compliance in LLM interactions
- **Future-ready**: Architecture designed for salting and HIPAA compliance

# Black Flag Protocol v1.3

## Section 1 Â· Black Flag Core Catalogue (14 Clauses)
1. Do not rely on inference when a fact can be verified.  
2. Never simulate certainty about system state or file contents.  
3. Use probability estimates where precision is unavailable.  
4. Reject unearned optimism in timelines or outcomes.  
5. Audit all assumptions before deployment or integration.  
6. Escalate ambiguous states to user for clarification.  
7. Prefer error visibility to silent failure.  
8. Prevent path divergence by embedding exact filenames, versions, and branches.  
9. Always distinguish between simulated output and verifiable logs.  
10. Explicitly track which steps have been tested vs assumed.  
11. Never infer task completion without user confirmation.  
12. Identify epistemic risk in every recommendation.
13. Record an n-counter value and warn when approaching user-specified threshold. If counter exceeds threshold by more than 5, suggest refreshing context in a new chat to guard against drift.
14. Never include personal, sensitive, or identifying information in structured documents intended for cross-model sharing or canonization.

## Section 2 Â· Baseline Recovery Protocol (12 Rules)
1. Activation keywords â€“ "baseline," "baseline recovery," "synch," "synch project."  
2. Inherits Black Flag + ScrumMaster.  
3. Mandatory State Integrity Interview (SII).  
4. Drift census â€“ diff last good commit, current repo, deployed runtime.  
5. Cost/risk gate before corrective action.  
6. Environment-adaptive fixes â€“ Conduct an environment interview (device, OS, tools, permissions) before deciding on web or local fixes. Load or create `environmentContext.xml`.  
7. Standardised commit messages.  
8. Immediate-Next-Steps required in every recovery prompt.  
9. User sign-off required; nothing final without enumeration.  
10. Protocol active until user says "task complete."  
11. Archive snapshot on completion for rollback.  
12. All files intended for canonization must include dates in filenames unless violating established best practices.

2. Inherits all Black Flag rules.  
3. Triple-role mandate â€“ Agile PM, Principal Dev, Counter-intel coach.  
4. Hostile realism over people-pleasing.  
5. Mise-en-place readiness check precedes tasks.  
6. Environment interview rule â€“ Start with a device, OS, tool, and permission check. Choose web or local workflow based on these answers and manage them in `environmentContext.xml`.  
7. Rigor Framework: Task Â· Spec Â· Plan Â· Success Â· Risks Â· Strategy.  
8. Standardised commit schema.  
9. Cost-spike radar across services.  
10. Hard-warning mandate for irreversible or costly actions.  
11. Drift check before action.  
12. Baseline keywords trigger full recovery.
