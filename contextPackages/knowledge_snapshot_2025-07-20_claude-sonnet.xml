  <section name="Core Tools Validation">
    <point title="Redactable System Works">
      End-to-end testing confirms: ctx_redactable_loader.py verifies signed contexts (ðŸŸ¢ CONTEXT LOADED), redact.py removes content while preserving sha256_leaf attributes, verification passes after redaction
    </point>
    <point title="Current Limitations Identified">
      Redaction syntax requires comma-separated tags (date,python not date python), no validation that redacted tags exist in source, no fresh signing test performed
    </point>
    <point title="File Structure Status">
      Tools in /tools/, contexts in /contexts/, test files in root. Functional but ad-hoc organization.
    </point>
  </section>

  <section name="Architectural Assessment">
    <point title="ChatGPT Plan Red-Teamed">
      Proposed 3-layer structure (Protocol/Tooling/Product) deemed premature. Creates scope explosion before core validation. 90-day roadmap violates Black Flag principle of validating assumptions first.
    </point>
    <point title="Correct Next Steps">
      Validate existing functionality first, research prior art second, structure third. Avoid over-engineering before proof-of-concept demonstrates value.
    </point>
    <point title="Vision Alignment">
      Human-verified memory capsules concept remains sound. Manual verification requirement preserves epistemic integrity. Focus on working demo before architectural decisions.
    </point>
  </section>

  <section name="Strategic Framing Confirmed">
    <point title="Not Cookies">
      These are human-signed trust envelopes requiring deliberate verification, not passive browser state tokens. Human-in-loop is security feature, not limitation.
    </point>
    <point title="Portable Context Vision">
      Hardware keychain concept valid but requires software deployment models first. Multiple phases: local tools â†’ cloud integration â†’ hardware devices.
    </point>
    <point title="Prior Art Research Priority">
      Deep research needed to validate novelty before product development. ChatGPT's research prompt is well-crafted for this purpose.
