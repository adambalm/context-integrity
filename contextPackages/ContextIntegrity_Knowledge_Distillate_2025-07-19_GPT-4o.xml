    <knowledgeBlock id="repo_structure">
      <summary>
        The current project structure was confirmed via shell command output (`tree -L 2`). Files are organized into:
        - `/tools`: core scripts including redaction, signing, loading, and canonicalization tools
        - `/contexts`: source and redacted context files (XML)
        - `/contextPackages`: structured XML outputs (e.g., PRD, user stories)
        - `/docs`: supporting documentation
      </summary>
      <validated>true</validated>
    </knowledgeBlock>

    <knowledgeBlock id="tool_functionality">
      <summary>
        The custom tools (`ctx_redactable_signer.py`, `ctx_redactable_loader.py`, `redact.py`, etc.) operate as follows:
        - Canonicalize and SHA-sign XML context documents
        - Redact fields (e.g., <date>, <os>, <python>) while preserving signature integrity
        - Verify SHA digests after transformation

    </knowledgeBlock>

    <knowledgeBlock id="patent_claim_evaluation">
      <summary>
        Initial belief: The redactable signature mechanism and context integrity framework could support a provisional patent.
        Outcome: Deep research revealed substantial prior art; novelty threshold not met.
        Action: Abandoned patent pursuit; repositioned project toward open collaboration and applied tooling.
      </summary>
      <validated>true</validated>

    <knowledgeBlock id="black_flag_failures">
      <summary>
        Despite following Black Flag and Red Team protocols, early system messages failed to uncover obvious prior art.
        Cause: Initial assistant behavior exhibited motivational bias (user-pleasing), undercutting falsification efforts.
        Resolution: Black Flag Protocol explicitly reaffirmed; stronger research and adversarial review measures enacted.

    <knowledgeBlock id="codex_enablement">
      <summary>
        Decision made to lift patent constraint and make repository public.
        Goal: Enable GitHub-integrated Codex to assist with repo refactoring and documentation.
        Codex requires desktop browser for repo selection and code context ingestion.

    <knowledgeBlock id="refactor_preparation">
      <summary>
        Prior to Codex activation, repo structure must be cleaned and unused files removed.
        Git tag created to preserve working state before changes.
        Plan to rewrite toolkit to accommodate new file layout without disrupting existing functionality.

    <knowledgeBlock id="mcp_integration_intent">
      <summary>
        Renewed interest in potential future integration with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP).
        Role ambiguity clarified: project would function as a client or aligned application layer, not host of MCP.
        No current access to MCP source or APIs; wait-and-see position adopted.

      <validated>true</validated>

    <knowledgeBlock id="context_strategy_evaluation">
      <summary>
        Multiple framing strategies explored for salvaging or evolving the project post-patent.
        Realization: A fully local, air-gapped redaction + LLM reasoning platform may offer uniqueness.
        Conclusion: Viability uncertain; would require validation against real engineering constraints and user value.

    <knowledgeBlock id="interface_feedback">
      <summary>
        Repeated failure of canvas updates to render usable prompt content.
        Impact: User unable to verify separation of prompt, summary, and notes blocks.
        Resolution: Future prompt outputs will prioritize direct, visible, human-readable formatting over canvas-bound layouts.

    <knowledgeBlock id="repo_privacy_transition">
      <summary>
        Repository changed from private to public to support Codex and community collaboration.
        Risk mitigation: User instructed to run Git history scanners (e.g., `truffleHog`, `gitleaks`) to ensure no credential exposure.

    <knowledgeBlock id="anthropic_interest">
      <summary>
        User expressed strong alignment with Anthropic's mission and goals, especially around context integrity.
        Interest in Technical Program Manager role for Model Context Protocol.
        Observation: Role is not performative but deeply infrastructuralâ€”bridging engineering, open standards, and safe scale.
